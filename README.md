WPI R Workshop
--------------

These are the materials for the R Workshop help at [WPI](http://www.wpi.edu/) on 2016-02-10.

Viewable at: <http://hrbrmstr.github.io/WPIRWorkshop/>

If you plan on trying to compile the handout R markdown document locally (assuming you install all dependent packages), you will also need to install the custom WPI template I made. You can do that by:

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("hrbrmstr/hrbrmrkdn")
```
